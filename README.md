# HeatConductionWithPhaseChangeSimulation
Matlab code for simulating heat conduction in a phase change material.

To run the examples all folders and subfolders need to be added to the matlab search path.

The StefanSim2 class can be used to setup, run, plot and evaluate simulations. The physicalData class is used to store physical data of some material at gridpoints and elements. Objects of the latter class are input of the simulation.
